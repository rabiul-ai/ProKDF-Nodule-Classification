# ProKDF-Nodule-Classification
A novel lung nodule classification framework


The work presents a novel Bayesian posterior probabilistic knowledge-based decision fusion (ProKDF) method for effectively classifying benign versus malignant nodules. The probabilistic knowledge is retrieved from the nodule size, which is a clinically accessible but significant medical prior. The proposed classification model is powered by four optimal models focusing on the deep and textural contextual information of lung nodules. We conducted a series of relevant experiments to determine the optimal model, knowledge reliance factor, the effect of input data modality, and the number of views. The competitive performance, along with interpretability and domain knowledge, makes the model highly reliable in clinical settings. In the medical domain, where data scarcity is a significant challenge, this novel approach of leveraging domain-specific priors represents a promising pathway.
